# 21-Game
21 Card Game in Python
This code follows the game "21". It first assigns values and suits, establishing all the cards. Then it shuffles the deck. Afterwards, the dealer (AI) recieves a card face-down, and every other player recieves a face-up card. Round 2 commences, and each player recieves a card once again (The dealer's second card is revealed to everybody).
